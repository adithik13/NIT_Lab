to begin understanding the efficacy of the subscalp eeg devices, 
we can train a model to understand if there is a stimulus understood
in a particular recording

to do this, we will need a dataset of multiple rats that are recorded. 
the rat eegs will have to be under normal conditons, without any specific 
stimulus, as well as with a specific defined stimulus

from this datset, we can train a model to recognize patterns in the eeg 
data, and understand whether or not there was a stimulus, given the 
rat's eeg response that is recorded. 

with this model, we can then pass our own data and understand whether 
or not the reading that we have is clear enough to accurately depict 
whether or not a stimulus was provided to the rat

if we pass a recording in which the rat was stimulated, the model should
return True. 

if we pass a recording in which the rat was not stimulater, the model 
should return False. 

one contender of a dataset to use for this task is the following: 

"Large scale multi-channel EEG in rats (v1)," EBRAINS

this dataset contains ssEEG recordings of two separate rats on three
consecutive days under anesthesia and under different levels of 
wakefullness which are specified in the dataset information
